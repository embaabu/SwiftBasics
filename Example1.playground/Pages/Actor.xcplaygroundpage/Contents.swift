//Actors was introduced in 2019
//actor is a refrence type similar like classes but does not support inheritance and this is thread safe


/*
 An actor is a reference type that protects its data from concurrent access by using data isolation. This means only one thread can access an actorâ€™s mutable state at a time, ensuring safe access in multi-threaded environments.
 
 */

/*
 
 a RACE CONDITION occurs when multiple threads simultaneously access and modify a shared resource. In a race condition, the outcome is unpredictable because it depends on the sequence and timing of certain events which are outside the control of the program.
 In concurrent programming, shared mutable state can lead to RACE CONDITION and undefined behavior
 Actors solve this by isolating the state, preventing direct access to its properties from outside. Instead, you interact with the actor asynchronously, ensuring thread safety.

 Structured concurrency in Swift allows you to organize your concurrent code in a way that makes it safer and easier to follow.
 async let allows for concurrent calls to the actor.

 With TaskGroup, we can add tasks dynamically, making this approach powerful for actor-based concurrency.
